    <h3>Biography</h3>
    Hello everyone, my name is Millicent Nwokorie but i prefer being called Miley
    My biography spans from the indigenous peple of Umuodagu Nsu in Ehime Mbano 
    community of the Igbo land. <br>
    The soil is know for its red color and sticky nature.
    Often times, the roads get slippery when it rains due to the muddy nature of the soil.
    <br>
    My ancestry dates back to the prehistoric times when plantain leaves were used as 
    for the body. My forefather went to the farm to pick some bush fruits when he encountered
    an animal of a deathly nature. <br>
    It was a black jaguar. It stared at my forefather who 
    could make no noise else his life could be taken away from him in seconds. My forefather 
    being the friendly man that he was stared back into the jaguar's eyes for what seemed like 
    minutes but was seconds. <br>
    After which, it seemed like the understood eachother because that 
    animal became his spirit animal. He became known as the black jaguar and that animal became 
    our family crest.
